 Arduino code decode several Acurite devices OTA data stream.
  
  Decoding protocol and prototype code from these sources:
  Ray Wang (Rayshobby LLC)

  Benjamin Larsson (RTL_433)

  Brad Hunting (Acurite_00592TX_sniffer) 
    https://github.com/bhunting/Acurite_00592TX_sniffer
 
  Written and tested on an Arduino Uno R3 Compatible Board
  using a RXB6 433Mhz Superheterodyne Wireless Receiver Module
  
  This works with these devices but more could be added
